  <h3>Announcement!</h3>
  <div class = "announce">
  <span>"Hey there, I am <span onclick="this.innerHTML = 'Andrew Berkowitz'">Everlyne Kaberere</span> from Kenya and am so excited to say that I got into the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) in Accra, Ghana. Am so excited about this awesome opportunity as I will be able to do what I love (tech), learn a lot of things, meet and interact with new people, be in a new country and of course eat new food. So you are asking what MEST is all about? Do not stress, I got you covered with information. MEST is a program offered where you get to meet smart people from Africa; South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Kenya. Business, Communications and Technology are some of the main courses taught in the program by awesome fellows from all over the world.
  Anyway, I am so excited about this opportunity. I will keep you people posted.
  Cheers!!!"</span>
